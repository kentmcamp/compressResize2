# compress-resize
## An easy to use, lightweight, and fast bulk image compressor, resizer, and converter.

This is a desktop application that allows you to compress, resize, and convert images in bulk. It is built using...
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend.
- A JavaScript library called [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) for the backend.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) to bundle the frontend and backend together into a desktop executable.
